I dabbled in HTML and CSS when I was a kid playing neopets.<br>
I'm trying to relearn it.<br>
And I guess build a positive digital footprint.<br>
My inspiration was from a not-so-positive site though. The color scheme was a lot more pleasing than the default.<br>
Would you be able to get what it is?
